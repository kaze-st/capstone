# SSCode
Project made by Hao Chen, Khoa Luong, Thomas That, and Nam Pham

## Description
SSCode is online tool that allows you to collaborate with other software developers in real time. It uses an online file storage and code editor so that you can create and store your scripts and share them with your friends. It aims to address the issues of remote software developments by providing a platform that's simple, interactive, and convenient.

## Key Features
- Online cloud storage
- Folders to organize files
- Code editor with autofill & autosave
- Offline support when disconnected from Wifi
- Multiple programming language support

## Future Plans
### **Our Team's Involvement**
While we are happy with how the progress of this project is going, we regret to inform you that we will not be continuing development after the Spring Quarter of 2021. Instead, we will be making this an open source project for other developers to continue from where we left off. This will give others the opportunity to improve on our project by continuing to add features that would be useful from multiple perspectives.

### **Notice**
Because we are going to be done with this project after Spring Quarter 2021, we will have to do an entire data wipe of our website. Any users who have tried our app and have important data on it, please be sure to copy and back up that data by **June 11, 2021**. We have not collected any data other than the data you have provided to us and it will be all wiped so that information is not made public. The website domain and any other APIs used will all be closed as well.

### **Out-of-Scope Features**
While we will stop development of this project, there is still other features that other developers can implement to improve what we have so far.

Purpose: The purpose of this project is to provide a collaboration space that is simple and convenient for anyone to use, so make sure to keep developing with this purpose in mind.

Research: Keep testing and innovating to find out what features users want out of this application.

Features Not Implemented: Here are a couple ideas that could be implemented that we didn't have time to prepare
- Connection to Github account
- Support more languages for both the editor and compiler
- Version control
- A debugger
- Customization options
- Etc.

## Acknowledgements
We'd like to thank thank our professor and TA, Frank and Lisa, for helping us with our progress in this project. We also thank everyone for being patient with our development on this project and we're excited to show the final build we have for our capstone.
